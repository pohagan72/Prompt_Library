This prompt was used to generate HTML from a screenshot of the Management Console page.

```prompt
Carefully analyze this image. It's a screenshot from a web application. 

I need this recreated in an HTML file. It doesn’t need to have back end functionality, but it does need to as closely as possible resemble the screenshot.

Keep in mind the following requirements:
•	What is the user experience like at a macro level? Is it like a multi-tab view? Is it like a web app? Is it tile based? Understand the style of experience and recreate it as carefully as possible so the output is true to the image.
•	Be careful about colour choices. Mimic as close as possible the colours in the screenshot
•	Include all the code in a single html file
•	Use standard python icons if needed
•	Use standard python fonts if needed

Before you generate the html file, carefully double check to make sure it’s as close as possible to the screenshot that’s been provided. And that you’re true to the defined requirements.
