This prompt was used to refine the rendered HTML by adding the credit concepts into the UX

```prompt
This HTML renders perfectly but I need an enhancement to the user experience.

Each tile represents an AI Agent. My plan is to sell each of these AI Agents together, so that you can purchase “Credits” and use those credits against any of the AI Agents.

Given that pricing model carefully review the HTML and generate a new version that shows that each AI Agent costs 5 credits, and that the user has 1,000 credits available.

Maintain as much as possible the existing look and feel. You are adding to what is there, not chaing what is there. 

Put the cost in the top right corner of the AI Agent tile in a red coloured text.

Put the available credits in the header in a red coloured text.
