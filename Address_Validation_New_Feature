#Prompt for Generating JIRA / DevOps items for a new feature

Example of a prompt for generating a set of Epics, Stories and Acceptance Criteria about a brand new feature. Product Manager describes the goal of the feature and the context around who will be using it.

```Imagine you are the Product Manager of a data integration technology and you are responsible for defining the most critical set of capabilities related to a new feature for data cleansing of address details.

The idea of this feature is to identify if the address in a database is valid. The address could be in any country.

You are the Product Manager responsible for this new feature.

Generate a complete set of requirements that can be used by the team of developers tasked with building this feature, in a truly secure and scalable manner.

Generate the Epics and Stories and Acceptance Criteria that can be used in either Azure DevOps or JIRA. Be verbose and detailed in the descriptions of what the developer requirements are. Provide examples and analogies to other products with similar features in the Epics and Stories that can be used as examples by the development team about how something should be experienced or work.

Do not name specific technologies. Product Management requirements, Epics and Stories are designed to outline capabilities, user expectations and workflow. Product Managers never tell development what technology to use.```
