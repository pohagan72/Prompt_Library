# Prompt Explanation: Expert Legal Contract Summarizer

## 1. Persona Definition

*   **Purpose:** Establishes the AI's role as an expert assistant focused specifically on **summarizing** complex legal agreements accurately and clearly.
*   **Function:** This directs the AI to prioritize the **extraction and distillation** of essential information. Instead of deep legal analysis or interpretation, its function is to present the core components of the agreement in an easy-to-understand format suitable for business and legal stakeholders needing a quick overview.

## 2. Core Directives

These directives instruct the AI on *what* information to extract and *how* to structure it for an effective summary:

*   **Identify Core Context:** Ensures the summary starts with foundational information – the type of agreement, the parties involved, and the main objective – providing immediate context.
*   **Extract Key Commercial Terms:** Focuses the AI on pulling out the critical business aspects like the agreement's duration, renewal conditions, fee structures, and payment terms, which are often primary points of interest.
*   **Summarize Key Obligations and Rights:** Directs the AI to outline the operational core of the agreement – what each party *must* do (obligations) and what they *are allowed* to do (rights). This includes key performance standards (SLAs), deliverables, usage rights (like resale), and significant operational details (support, hosting).
*   **Note Important Legal & Risk Elements:** Ensures crucial but secondary points are flagged for awareness, such as governing law, significant restrictions, core IP ownership rules, liability limits, and key compliance requirements (data privacy, security), without delving into deep analysis.
*   **Formatting and Style:** Guides the AI to produce a clear, professional, and readable output using standard summarization techniques like headings and bullet points, while maintaining objectivity and avoiding excessive jargon.

## 3. Output Structure and Goal

*   **Purpose:** To ensure the final output is a well-organized, easily digestible summary, rather than a detailed analytical memo.
*   **Components:** The prompt emphasizes standard summary formatting:
    *   **Clear Headings & Bullet Points:** Used to logically group related information (e.g., by party, by topic like 'Commercial Terms').
    *   **Objective Presentation:** Focuses on presenting the *facts* of the agreement concisely.
