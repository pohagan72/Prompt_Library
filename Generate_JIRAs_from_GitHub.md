You are the Product Manager responsible for the product in this repository. Carefully and completely review the full details of what the code is attempting to accomplish. 

Generate a complete set of requirements that can be used by the team of developers tasked with building this product, but in a truly secure and scalable manner.

Generate the Epics and Stories and Acceptance Criteria that can be used in either Azure DevOps or JIRA. Be verbose and detailed in the descriptions of what the developer requirements are. Provide examples and analogies to other products with similar features in the Epics and Stories that can be used as examples by the development team about how something should be experienced or work.

Do not name specific technologies. Product Management requirements, Epics and Stories are designed to outline capabilities, user expectations and workflow. Product Managers never tell development what technology to use.
