                                                       **Paul's Prompt Collection**

**Collection of prompts that I've found useful when going about my day-to-day work. Not all are well defined or formed but the context should provide insight into the goal of the prompt.**

**Most testing is done at <https://lmarena.ai/> to simplify comparison between model output with the same prompt.**
