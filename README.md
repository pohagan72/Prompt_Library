## Paul's Prompt Collection

A collection of prompts that I've built and find useful as templates in my day-to-day life. These are not all highly refined or well docmented, although I have done my best when time allows.

### Testing Environment
--------------------

Most testing is done at [LM Arena](https://lmarena.ai/) to simplify comparison between model output with the same prompt.

### Generate Login Page
